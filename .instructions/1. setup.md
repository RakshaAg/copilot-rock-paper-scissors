### Installing a supported IDE on your machine

If you __DO NOT__ have one of the following:
- VSCode
- Visual Studio
- NeoVIM
- JetBrains IDE

on your local machine, you will need to install one of these IDEs to use GitHub Copilot and complete the exercises.

If you have no preference, we suggest you install VSCode. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
